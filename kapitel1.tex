\chapter{Introduction}
With the recent rise of convolutional neural networks and other deep learning models these models get used in more and more AI applications. Many of these application are deployed on edge devices such as smartphones or cars with limited computational power. But since deep learning models often need quite a big amount of computational power the question arose whether the models should be deployed directly on the edge devices or on a cloud-backend where more computational power is available. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Example application
    \item resulting trade-offs
    \item methodlogy to describs deployment to help decision
\end{itemize}
The rest of this thesis is structured as follows: In chapter 2, an overview over the existing related work is given. Next, a methodology for characterizing the deployment
Section 3 deals with the experiments, their design, execution and the evaluation of the results
Finally, this thesis concludes with a conclusion and future work.
