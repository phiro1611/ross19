\chapter{Methodology}
In this section a performance model for understanding the runtime characteristics of deep learning models is outlined. To understand these characteristics, the underlying factors that affect it need to be understood first. 
\section{Problem Space}
The inference performance of a deep learning model is mainly affected by two major parts, the structure of the model itself and the hardware environment where it gets deployed. A third factor is the serving framework.

\subsection{Deep Learning}
Deep learning models describe neural network with many layers and hidden units, the most popular being convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks right now. %This increased amount of layers leads to complex mathematical calculations.
\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Network}
This special subclass of neural network achieved wide success in the field of object recognition and detection in images. 
\subsubsection{Recurrent Neural Network}
Recurrent neural network are made for the processing of sequences and made a lot a progress in the fields of voice recognition.

\section{Deployment}
Model deployment describes the process of deploying a trained machine learning model to a production environment.
\subsection{Edge Deployment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was ist Edge (Beispiele)
    \item Was macht Edge aus?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cloud Deployment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Was ist cloud?
    \item Was macht cloud aus
\end{itemize}
\section{Deployment Trade-offs}
